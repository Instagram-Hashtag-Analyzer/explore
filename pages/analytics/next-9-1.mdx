Today, we are excited to announce Next.js 9.1 with `src` and `public` directory support.

**New in This Release**

- **[`src` Directory Support](#src-directory-support)**: The `pages` directory can now be nested under the `src` folder, supporting a wider variety of application setups.
- **[`public` Directory Support](#public-directory-support)**: Define files to be mounted at the root of your application's URL (e.g. `favicon.ico`).

**Previewing in This Release**

- **[Built-in CSS Support](#built-in-css-support)**: Applications can soon import Global CSS and leverage development hot reloading and advanced production optimizations, compilation, and polyfilling.
- **[Static Error Pages](#static-error-pages)**: Statically export expected error pages (like 404) for better availability (CDN).
- **[Module / Nomodule](#module--nomodule)**: Ship smaller JavaScript bundles to end-users running on evergreen browsers.
- **[Improved Bundle Splitting](#improved-bundle-splitting)**: Ship fewer bytes to your end-user, improving TTI and page transition speed. Large library chunks are also long-term cached across deploys.

As always, we strive to ensure all of these benefits are backward compatible. All you need to do to update is run:

<TerminalInput
  prefix
>{`npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest`}</TerminalInput>

If your application is on a version of Next.js before 9 you can reference the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/UPGRADING.md) for changes you may need to upgrade.

Since our last major release, we are happy to have seen companies like [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/), [Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton/), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), [Realtor](https://www.realtor.com/), and [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/) launch with Next.js. Check out the [showcase](https://nextjs.org/showcase) for more!

### `src` directory support

Next.js has a special `pages` directory where every file becomes a separate route, following the convention over configuration approach this directory is required to be in the root of a Next.js application.

In talking with companies using Next.js and inspecting some closed source codebases we established a common pattern developers wanted is to have a `src` directory for their code and have the `pages` directory within it also.

Starting from Next.js 9.1, it's now possible to create a `src/pages` directory instead of creating a `pages` directory in the root of the application.

Using the `src` directory is optional and covers the case where your company has this standard in place already.

  height={812 / 2}
/>

### `public` directory support

Besides the `pages` directory Next.js has one other special directory called `static`, files of which were mapped to the `/static` route.

For example, `static/my-image.png` would be mapped to `/static/my-image.png`.

This convention has worked out well ever since the first release of Next.js and doesn't have problems in particular.

However, over time we have established that `/static` doesn't cover everything needed in a web application. For example, `robots.txt` has to be served from the root of the domain.

Starting from Next.js 9.1 we are introducing a new directory called `public`.

Any files in the `public` directory will be mapped to the root of the domain.

For example, `public/robots.txt` will be mapped to `/robots.txt`.

Because `public` also covers the `static` directory use case we have decided to deprecate the `static` directory in favor of creating a `public/static` folder with the same functionality.

As always we strive for backward compatibility so the `static` directory will continue to work with a deprecation message.

## Coming Soon

The following features are currently under an experimental flag and will be released once the final implementation is ready.

### Built-in CSS Support

Currently, Next.js has a CSS-in-JS solution built-in called [styled-jsx](http://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx). This solution works well for styling individual React components.

However, when talking to companies we found there is a common need to reuse some existing styling or design system based around CSS.

In general, this means adding in the `next-css` plugin to add CSS imports support.

We found that around 50% of all Next.js users add this plugin to their application.

Because of this extensive usage, we are adding built-in support for CSS imports with automatic reloading of styles in development and production optimizations that were previously not possible in the `next-css` plugin.

The initial implementation is currently being tested on production Next.js applications.

Global CSS imports will be introduced first:

```jsx
// pages/_app.js

// Global styles can be imported from _app.js
import '../styles/global.css'
import App from 'next/app'

export default App
```

After global CSS imports we'll introduce support for CSS modules through the `.module.css` extension:

```jsx
// pages/index.js

// Scoped styles are imported through .module.css
import styles from '../styles/index.module.css'

export default function HomePage() {
  return <h1 className={styles.heading}>Hello World</h1>
}
```

This will allow us to provide a significantly better developer experience when using CSS imports.

You can read more about the ongoing work on the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/8626).

### Static Error Pages

Next.js has a special page rendered when an error happens, this page is internally called `/_error`. This page can be customized by users by creating a `pages/_error.js` file that exports a React Component.

The rendered errors are generally divided into 2 cases: expected errors and unexpected errors.

Expected errors are, for example, the `404` page.

An unexpected error would be, for example, when an error is thrown in `getInitialProps` or while rendering the React tree, which renders a `500`.

We are planning to add the [automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#automatic-static-optimization) for expected errors as in general, they do not have to be dynamically rendered.

There will be an opt-out if a user wants to dynamically render these pages but the default will be that `404` will be a static page. This reduces the load on the server when using the `server` target and reduces cost when using the `serverless` target.

Another benefit of making the page static is that it can be cached automatically when using a CDN.

## Google Chrome Collaboration

As shared in the [Next.js 9 announcement](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#google-chrome-collaboration) the Google Chrome team is investing resources into improving Next.js and has been working on multiple efforts to make large-scale performance improvements for all Next.js applications.

To learn more about this collaboration you can read the [Next.js 9 announcement](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#google-chrome-collaboration) and watch [this talk by Nicole Sullivan at React Rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD8UQeYm5Vk).

### Module / Nomodule

When writing code in Next.js you generally write “modern” JavaScript. You can use all the latest stable features and Next.js will automatically ensure that these features are transformed or polyfilled through compiling the code using Babel.

At this point, many of these JavaScript features are supported in the majority of browsers. However, in general, (including in Next.js) code is shipped as a single JavaScript bundle that runs on all browsers that your application supports.

In the case of Next.js, this means compiling the modern JavaScript down to a format that is compatible with Internet Explorer 11.

For example, currently, Next.js has to provide polyfills for async/await syntax as code might be executed in browsers that do not support async/await which would break.

To avoid breaking older browsers while sending modern JavaScript to browsers that support newer syntax Next.js will utilize the [module/nomodule](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) pattern. The module/nomodule pattern provides a reliable mechanism for serving modern JavaScript to modern browsers while allowing older browsers to fall back to polyfilled ES5 code.

This new feature is currently being tested in production by multiple large-scale Next.js applications to collect real-world data. The results of these tests are looking promising and more details on the performance improvements of this change will be shared soon.

One example of initial results we have seen is this comparison by [Natalie Marleny](https://twitter.com/NatalieMarleny) about the bundle sizes before and after enabling built-in module/nomodule support in Next.js:

### Improved Bundle Splitting

Next.js currently has multiple JavaScript bundles it loads to make a page interactive. Most notably:

- The page JavaScript bundle.
- A file with common JavaScript.
- Next.js client-side runtime bundle.
- Dynamic imports (generally added through `next/dynamic`).

To ensure the page gets interactive, all these bundles have to load as they all depend on each other to be able to boot up React in the browser.

Because these bundles are required to be loaded for React to boot up, it’s important that they are as optimized as possible and don’t over-download too much code from the rest of the application.

For this reason, there is a `commons` bundle that holds common JavaScript between pages. The calculation of the current bundle-splitting strategy to generate `commons` is based around a ratio-based heuristic, if a module is used in 50% of all pages it’ll be marked as a common module.

However, applications could exist out of many different pieces. For example, marketing pages, a blog, and a dashboard. If there was a large number of marketing pages compared to the dashboard the commons calculation would cause a more optimized result for the marketing pages.

Our goal is to optimize both of these at the same time in one application.

Alex Castle defined a new layer of chunking (creation of separate JavaScript files) that allows more optimized commons chunking with multiple files and especially when many pages are involved.

Similar to the module/nomodule support the improved bundle splitting is being tested in production by multiple large-scale Next.js applications to collect real-world data. The results of these tests and more details on the performance improvements of this change will be shared soon in a separate blog post.
