We are happy to introduce Next.js 5.1, which features support for environment configuration, phases, source maps, and new Next.js plugins.

Major performance improvements are introduced: resolving pages is **102x** faster, and error pages are loaded more efficiently.

To upgrade or install, run:

<TerminalInput
  prefix
>{`npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest`}</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  In addition to bumping Next.js, we upgrade the peer dependencies{' '}
  <Caption.Code>react</Caption.Code> and <Caption.Code>react-dom</Caption.Code>
</Caption>

Be sure to upgrade [next-plugins](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins) like `@zeit/next-css`, `@zeit/next-sass`, `@zeit/next-less` or `@zeit/next-typescript` as well.

## Faster page resolution

Thanks to the architectural changes in Next.js 5.0, we were able to [simplify the logic](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/3776) that resolves pages based on url path. These changes were based on [research](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/3682) from [@oliviertassinari](https://github.com/oliviertassinari).
Previously resolving a page took an average of **2.347ms**. With the new logic resolving the same page takes on average **0.023ms**. That's a **102x** speedup for one of the most commonly invoked methods in Next.js applications.

## Environment configuration

Typical Node.js environments often depend on passing environment variables to the application, for example: `API_URL=https://api.zeit.co node index.js` and then you can use `API_URL` anywhere in your application using `process.env.API_URL`.

With universal rendering `process.env` is not available on the client side. So with Next 5.1 we're introducing a new feature: `publicRuntimeConfig` and `serverRuntimeConfig`. These can be set in `next.config.js` and will then be available using the `next/config` module.

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  serverRuntimeConfig: {
    // Will only be available on the server side
    mySecret: 'secret'
  },
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    // Will be available on both server and client
    staticFolder: '/static'
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Both <Caption.Code>serverRuntimeConfig</Caption.Code> and{' '}
  <Caption.Code>publicRuntimeConfig</Caption.Code> are defined in{' '}
  <Caption.Code>next.config.js</Caption.Code>
</Caption>

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import getConfig from 'next/config'
const { serverRuntimeConfig, publicRuntimeConfig } = getConfig()

console.log(serverRuntimeConfig.mySecret) // Will only be available on the server side
console.log(publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder) // Will be available on both server and client

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={`${publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder}/logo.png`} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Caption>
  The <Caption.Code>getConfig</Caption.Code> method from the{' '}
  <Caption.Code>next/config</Caption.Code> module is used to get configuration
  values
</Caption>

## Improved Error Handling

Previously Next.js had a special error handling mechanism for detecting server errors when loading page bundles. A page bundle is the javascript file that is loaded on the client side to load the page, for example `/_next/-/page/index.js`.

If there were an error, like a build ID mismatch, the page bundle would still be served with a 200 HTTP status, but the contents would be a JSON representation of an error generated by the Next.js server. The reason for this is that there was client side error handling that depended on more than just the page being a 404. This solution worked really well, until you try to upload assets to a static file host or CDN that doesn't support a fallback.

With Next.js 5.1 we've [completely refactored](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/3849) the error handling logic, when a page bundle returns a 404 HTTP status the router will automatically detect it and reload the page, to make sure navigation between [multi-zones](https://github.com/vercel/next.js#multi-zones) is possible.

In rewriting this logic, we [removed the `Router.onAppUpdated` hook](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/errors/no-on-app-updated-hook.md); which was mainly used to trigger a page reload. Now the page will be automatically reloaded

In addition to this, we've added a new set of [integration tests](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/3895) on error recovery in the development mode, to avoid regressions on error recovery in future releases.

## Phases / config function

Some [next-plugins](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins) like [`@zeit/next-css`](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-css) are only required when Next.js is in development mode or when running `next build`.

You can now export a function that returns the configuration object instead of immediately exporting the object.

```js
module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => config
```

<Caption>
  <Caption.Code>next.config.js</Caption.Code> exporting a function that returns
  the user configuration
</Caption>

Exporting a function will give you access to the `phase` in which Next.js is running, for example development, production, building, export. This allows plugins to be loaded only when needed, but also gives access to the default configuration.

We've introduced a new module called [`next/constants`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/lib/constants.js) holding commonly used constants, including phases.

```js
const {PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER} = require('next/constants')
module.exports = (phase, {defaultConfig}){
  if(phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
    return { /* development only config options here */ }
  }

  return { /* config options for all phases except development here */ }
}
```

<Caption>
  A <Caption.Code>next.config.js</Caption.Code> that checks for the development
  phase

## Improved production source map generation

With the introduction of universal webpack in [Next.js 5](/blog/next5) adding source maps to your production environment became as simple as adding a few lines to `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack(config, { dev }) {
    if (!dev) {
      config.devtool = 'source-map'
      for (const plugin of config.plugins) {
        if (plugin['constructor']['name'] === 'UglifyJsPlugin') {
          plugin.options.sourceMap = true
          break
        }
      }
    }
    return config
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Manually enable source maps in <Caption.Code>next.config.js</Caption.Code>
</Caption>

[@zeit/next-source-maps](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-source-maps) can be added to a project to automatically enable production source maps for you, add the following to `next.config.js`:

```js
const withSourceMaps = require('@zeit/next-source-maps')
module.exports = withSourceMaps()
```

<Caption>
  Using <Caption.Code>@zeit/next-source-maps</Caption.Code> to enable source
  maps in <Caption.Code>next.config.js</Caption.Code>
</Caption>

This enabled outputting of source maps for all but one file, `app.js`, the reason for this was that `app.js` consisted of multiple files (`manifest.js` and `commons.js`) combined with a webpack plugin. A side effect of this was that webpack couldn't generate source maps for the combined file.

Thanks to a [pull request](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/3793) from [@ptomasroos](https://github.com/ptomasroos) the `app.js` file was replaced by `main.js`. This file will hold the code that was previously compiled to `manifest.js` and `commons.js` and webpack will generate a source map for `main.js`. Source maps will be automatically served, allowing external error tracking tools to show the actual file an line number when errors are detected.

## New plugins / improvements to existing ones

We've introduced two new official plugins. [@zeit/next-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-bundle-analyzer) allows for easily setting up `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to analyze the server side and client side bundles separately.

Additionally there were a lot of improvements to the official [`css`](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-css), [`less`](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-less), and [`sass`](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass) plugins regarding hot reloading and bundling. For example there is no longer a flash of unstyled content in development mode. And styles in subcomponents get picked up as well.
